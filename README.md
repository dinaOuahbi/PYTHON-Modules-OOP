# PYTHON-modules-oop

The basic modules of python : https://docs.python.org/3/py-modindex.html

MODULES AND PACKAGES : INTRO

File is a module

So we can create a module that contains specific functions that we have created before

Then we could import this module into our project to use its functions

pycach : added to current directory whene we import our module, it will create connections between modules

From module_1 import * : import all functions

Package is a library of several modules

W'll see some of them : math / stat / random / glob / os

OBJECT ORIENTED programing (OOP)

In oop: everything is an object
All objects have attributes and perform actions.
Actions are called "methods."
Notion of class = object design plan, allows to build different objects of the same class
